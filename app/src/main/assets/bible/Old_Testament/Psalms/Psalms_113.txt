1 Praise the Lord . Praise, O servants of the Lord , praise the name of the Lord .  
2 Let the name of the Lord be praised, both now and forevermore.  
3 From the rising of the sun to the place where it sets, the name of the Lord is to be praised.  
4 The Lord is exalted over all the nations, his glory above the heavens.  
5 Who is like the Lord our God, the One who sits enthroned on high,  
6 who stoops down to look on the heavens and the earth?  
7 He raises the poor from the dust and lifts the needy from the ash heap;  
8 he seats them with princes, with the princes of their people.  
9 He settles the barren woman in her home as a happy mother of children. Praise the Lord .
