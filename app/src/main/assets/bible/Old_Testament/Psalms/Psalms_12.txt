1 Help, Lord , for the godly are no more; the faithful have vanished from among men.  
2 Everyone lies to his neighbor; their flattering lips speak with deception.  
3 May the Lord cut off all flattering lips and every boastful tongue  
4 that says, "We will triumph with our tongues; we own our lips -who is our master?"  
5 "Because of the oppression of the weak and the groaning of the needy, I will now arise," says the Lord . "I will protect them from those who malign them."  
6 And the words of the Lord are flawless, like silver refined in a furnace of clay, purified seven times.  
7 O Lord , you will keep us safe and protect us from such people forever.  
8 The wicked freely strut about when what is vile is honored among men.
