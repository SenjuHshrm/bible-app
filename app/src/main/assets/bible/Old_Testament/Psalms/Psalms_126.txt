1 When the Lord brought back the captives to Zion, we were like men who dreamed.  
2 Our mouths were filled with laughter, our tongues with songs of joy. Then it was said among the nations, "The Lord has done great things for them."  
3 The Lord has done great things for us, and we are filled with joy.  
4 Restore our fortunes, O Lord , like streams in the Negev.  
5 Those who sow in tears will reap with songs of joy.  
6 He who goes out weeping, carrying seed to sow, will return with songs of joy, carrying sheaves with him.
