1 Unless the Lord builds the house, its builders labor in vain. Unless the Lord watches over the city, the watchmen stand guard in vain.  
2 In vain you rise early and stay up late, toiling for food to eat- for he grants sleep to those he loves.  
3 Sons are a heritage from the Lord , children a reward from him.  
4 Like arrows in the hands of a warrior are sons born in one's youth.  
5 Blessed is the man whose quiver is full of them. They will not be put to shame when they contend with their enemies in the gate.
