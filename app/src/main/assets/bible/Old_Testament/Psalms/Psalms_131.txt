1 My heart is not proud, O Lord , my eyes are not haughty; I do not concern myself with great matters or things too wonderful for me.  
2 But I have stilled and quieted my soul; like a weaned child with its mother, like a weaned child is my soul within me.  
3 O Israel, put your hope in the Lord both now and forevermore.
