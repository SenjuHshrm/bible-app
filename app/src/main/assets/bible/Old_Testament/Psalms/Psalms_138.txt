1 I will praise you, O Lord , with all my heart; before the "gods" I will sing your praise.  
2 I will bow down toward your holy temple and will praise your name for your love and your faithfulness, for you have exalted above all things your name and your word.  
3 When I called, you answered me; you made me bold and stouthearted.  
4 May all the kings of the earth praise you, O Lord , when they hear the words of your mouth.  
5 May they sing of the ways of the Lord , for the glory of the Lord is great.  
6 Though the Lord is on high, he looks upon the lowly, but the proud he knows from afar.  
7 Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my life; you stretch out your hand against the anger of my foes, with your right hand you save me.  
8 The Lord will fulfill his purpose for me; your love, O Lord , endures forever- do not abandon the works of your hands.
