1 Praise the Lord . Praise the Lord , O my soul.  
2 I will praise the Lord all my life; I will sing praise to my God as long as I live.  
3 Do not put your trust in princes, in mortal men, who cannot save.  
4 When their spirit departs, they return to the ground; on that very day their plans come to nothing.  
5 Blessed is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God,  
6 the Maker of heaven and earth, the sea, and everything in them- the Lord , who remains faithful forever.  
7 He upholds the cause of the oppressed and gives food to the hungry. The Lord sets prisoners free,  
8 the Lord gives sight to the blind, the Lord lifts up those who are bowed down, the Lord loves the righteous.  
9 The Lord watches over the alien and sustains the fatherless and the widow, but he frustrates the ways of the wicked.  
10 The Lord reigns forever, your God, O Zion, for all generations. Praise the Lord .
