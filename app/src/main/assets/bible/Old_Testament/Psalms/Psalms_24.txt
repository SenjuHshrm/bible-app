1 The earth is the Lord 's, and everything in it, the world, and all who live in it;  
2 for he founded it upon the seas and established it upon the waters.  
3 Who may ascend the hill of the Lord ? Who may stand in his holy place?  
4 He who has clean hands and a pure heart, who does not lift up his soul to an idol or swear by what is false.  
5 He will receive blessing from the Lord and vindication from God his Savior.  
6 Such is the generation of those who seek him, who seek your face, O God of Jacob. Selah  
7 Lift up your heads, O you gates; be lifted up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.  
8 Who is this King of glory? The Lord strong and mighty, the Lord mighty in battle.  
9 Lift up your heads, O you gates; lift them up, you ancient doors, that the King of glory may come in.  
10 Who is he, this King of glory? The Lord Almighty- he is the King of glory. Selah
