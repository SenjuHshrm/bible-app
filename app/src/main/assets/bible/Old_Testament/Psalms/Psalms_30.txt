1 I will exalt you, O Lord , for you lifted me out of the depths and did not let my enemies gloat over me.  
2 O Lord my God, I called to you for help and you healed me.  
3 O Lord , you brought me up from the grave ; you spared me from going down into the pit.  
4 Sing to the Lord , you saints of his; praise his holy name.  
5 For his anger lasts only a moment, but his favor lasts a lifetime; weeping may remain for a night, but rejoicing comes in the morning.  
6 When I felt secure, I said, "I will never be shaken."  
7 O Lord , when you favored me, you made my mountain stand firm; but when you hid your face, I was dismayed.  
8 To you, O Lord , I called; to the Lord I cried for mercy:  
9 "What gain is there in my destruction, in my going down into the pit? Will the dust praise you? Will it proclaim your faithfulness?  
10 Hear, O Lord , and be merciful to me; O Lord , be my help."  
11 You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,  
12 that my heart may sing to you and not be silent. O Lord my God, I will give you thanks forever.
