1 Answer me when I call to you, O my righteous God. Give me relief from my distress; be merciful to me and hear my prayer.  
2 How long, O men, will you turn my glory into shame ? How long will you love delusions and seek false gods ? Selah  
3 Know that the Lord has set apart the godly for himself; the Lord will hear when I call to him.  
4 In your anger do not sin; when you are on your beds, search your hearts and be silent. Selah  
5 Offer right sacrifices and trust in the Lord .  
6 Many are asking, "Who can show us any good?" Let the light of your face shine upon us, O Lord .  
7 You have filled my heart with greater joy than when their grain and new wine abound.  
8 I will lie down and sleep in peace, for you alone, O Lord , make me dwell in safety.
