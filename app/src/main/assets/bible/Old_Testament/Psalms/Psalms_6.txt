1 O Lord , do not rebuke me in your anger or discipline me in your wrath.  
2 Be merciful to me, Lord , for I am faint; O Lord , heal me, for my bones are in agony.  
3 My soul is in anguish. How long, O Lord , how long?  
4 Turn, O Lord , and deliver me; save me because of your unfailing love.  
5 No one remembers you when he is dead. Who praises you from the grave 1 ?  
6 I am worn out from groaning; all night long I flood my bed with weeping and drench my couch with tears.  
7 My eyes grow weak with sorrow; they fail because of all my foes.  
8 Away from me, all you who do evil, for the Lord has heard my weeping.  
9 The Lord has heard my cry for mercy; the Lord accepts my prayer.  
10 All my enemies will be ashamed and dismayed; they will turn back in sudden disgrace.
