1 The Lord reigns, he is robed in majesty; the Lord is robed in majesty and is armed with strength. The world is firmly established; it cannot be moved.  
2 Your throne was established long ago; you are from all eternity.  
3 The seas have lifted up, O Lord , the seas have lifted up their voice; the seas have lifted up their pounding waves.  
4 Mightier than the thunder of the great waters, mightier than the breakers of the sea- the Lord on high is mighty.  
5 Your statutes stand firm; holiness adorns your house for endless days, O Lord .
